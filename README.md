I used different animals in the zoo and a different inheritance pattern, although it does contain the required "at least three levels of inheritance" as well as 8 animals as is used in slide 16 of lecture 5.
The inheritance goes as: 

    -> Animal 
              -> Invertebrate 
                              -> Cnidarians
                              -> Mollusks
              -> Vertebrate   
                              -> Mammal
                              -> Reptile
